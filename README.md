Practice Reports for penetration tests and assessments

These documents are based on the practice Penetration Testing Report from the Udemy Course "Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course."

https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report/blob/master/README.md
I used this practice report to write penetration testing reports for each lab in the course.
